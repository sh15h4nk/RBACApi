# RBACApi
This app can be done with much more functionality and much more features.
but, the basics idea is to demonstrate role based access control to the user

I used JWT to give RBAC to the user by segregating the routes by the roles and authenticating by a middleware in the ./JwtManager.js


# Usage

`npm install ` to install all the dependencies
`npm run dev ` to run the api 

By default the api will run @localhost:1337
